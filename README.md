# Facial  Recogination
This model is created to be used as a Facial recogination model in a software. It helps to distinguish between different faces of human beings so it to used for identification purposes or to lock your phone as a security tool also. Concept of transfer learning is used in this model. For that we have used the mobile.Net as our transfer learning model to have better accuracy rate. For dataset images of two individuals is used so to check if machine is successfull in to  distinguish between them or not. Finally model with best accuracy is saved automatically as a .h5 file so to be used in which ever platform is needed ,so that no need to carry around the code forever.

##  Transfer Learning 
Transfer learning is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.

## Mobile Net
MobileNet is an architecture which is more suitable for mobile and embedded based vision applications where there is lack of compute power. This architecture was proposed by Google.For more info on mobile net click here ->https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/06/mobilenets-open-source-models-for.html
